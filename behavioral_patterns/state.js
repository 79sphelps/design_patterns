Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will
appear to change its class.

Frequency of use (in JavaScript): medium low

Summary
The State pattern provides state-specific logic to a limited set of objects in which
each object represents a particular state. This is best explained with an example.

Say a customer places an online order for a TV. While this order is being processed
it can in one of many states: New, Approved, Packed, Pending, Hold, Shipping, Completed,
or Canceled. If all goes well the sequence will be New, Approved, Packed, Shipped, and
Completed. However, at any point something unpredictable may happen, such as no inventory,
breakage, or customer cancelation. If that happens the order needs to be handled appropriately.

Applying the State pattern to this scenario will provide you with 8 State objects, each
with its own set of properties (state) and methods (i.e. the rules of acceptable state
transitions). State machines are often implemented using the State pattern. These
state machines simply have their State objects swapped out with another one when a
state transition takes place.

Two other examples where the State pattern is useful include:
- vending machines that dispense products when a correct combination of coins is entered,
- and elevator logic which moves riders up or down depending on certain complex rules
  that attempt to minimize wait and ride times.
