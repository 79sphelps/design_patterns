Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without
exposing its underlying representation.

Frequency of use (in JavaScript): high

Summary
The Iterator pattern allows clients to effectively loop over a collection of objects

A common programming task is to traverse and manipulate a collection of objects.
These collections may be stored as an array or perhaps something more complex,
such as a tree or graph structure. In addition, you may need to access the items
in the collection in a certain order, such as, front to back, back to front,
depth first (as in tree searches), skip evenly numbered objects, etc.

The Iterator design pattern solves this problem by separating the collection of
objects from the traversal of these objects by implementing a specialized iterator.

Today, many languages have Iterators built-in by supporting 'for-each'-type
constructs and IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces. However, JavaScript only
supports basic looping in the form of for, for-in, while, and do while statements.

The Iterator pattern allows JavaScript developers to design looping constructs
that are far more flexible and sophisticated.
